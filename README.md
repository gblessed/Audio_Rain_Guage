Dataset Description:

As part of the ITU Tinly ML challenge, The team collected a total 7,800 secs of audio recordings from Kogi state in Nigeria over a two month period. These recordings were collected using an android smartphone. MFCC was extracted from the audio recordings which was used to train three ML models, a Support Vector Regression  and a CNN model. The models were tested on different splits. The model was pruned and quantized using Tensorflow Lite for onward deployment on an ESP32 board. (A more detailed description is in the report in the ppt above)
